src/config/graphQL Files

1) prisma.yml: The root configuration file for your Prisma service.
2) datamodel.graphql: Contains the definition of your data model in SDL (Prisma will translate this into an according database schema).
3) prisma.graphql: Prisma database schema
4) .graphqlconfig.yml

Whenever you're updating the data model (and therefore the Prisma database schema) by running prisma deploy, the CLI will automatically download the schema for the updated API. 
To do so, add the following code to the end of prisma.yml:
